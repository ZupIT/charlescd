# Users Groups

A user group can represent a team or even a subset of people based on their skills.

For example, a big team would have different Charles access permissions according to their job position, we could have these groups:

* _Product X developers;_
* _Product X QAs;_
* _Product X Data Analysts._

However, if everyone in a team have the same permission, we are able to create only one group with its users.

* _Product X Team._

## Permissions for user groups in your workspace

Charles permissions are given to a user group when you associate them to a workspace.

The following profiles are available:

* **Maintainer**: can access and edit all workspace configuration. They can do implementations and create, edit and delete circles, hypothesis and modules. 
* **Developer**: they have access to do implementations

  and also create, edit and delete circles, modules and hypothesis.

* **Analyst**: they have permission to edit and delete circles, modules and hypothesis. And also view the modules configuration.
* **Reader**: is able to view circles, hypothesis and modules.
