# Key Concepts

## Circles

**Circles** are groups of users created from specific characteristics inside the same environment on Charles platform. The developer is able to segment users according to the rules AND/OR that will make more sense to test that release later.

For example, it is possible to [**create a circle**](https://docs.charlescd.io/v/v0.2.1-en/reference/circles) of engineers from north of Brazil and another one from the southeast, and a third one with all brazilian engineers. Based on this client segmentation, it is possible to make a variety of deployment logics.

## **Hypothesis**

They are [**registred alternatives** ](https://docs.charlescd.io/v/v0.2.1-en/reference/hyphotesis)on the platform to solve a problem or to validate changes on the application you have integrated on Charles.

Hypothesis can have features that are directly related to modules and/or projects that were previously registered in your workspace.

## **Circle Matcher**

It is a HTPP service that allows you to identify which segmentation the application belongs to based on predefined logic rules. For that, Circle Matcher receives a JSON request with the user's attributes and also the circle identifier of which group that user belongs.

## **Components**

Components are part of the [**modules**](https://docs.charlescd.io/v/v0.2.1-en/get-started/creating-your-first-module) you create on Charles. They work as an application abstraction, which means that they have their own configuration and every part of it belongs to a module application you are working on it.

## Open Sea

This term was originated with Charles and it's used to refer to a generic segmentation that are within all users inserted in the platform and that are not linked to a circle.

For example, if you add 300 users to your database and don't specify which segmentation you want to direct your hypothesis, Charles will redirect it to all, that is when your hypothesis will fall into the open sea.
