# Git Credentials

While you are configuring your workspace, you need to register on Git, to grant access to your repositories. This access is important because Charles will be able to create, delete and merge branches during the hypothesis board use, and it is also possible to view and create releases.

There are two register categories: GitHub and GitLab. To configure it, add the following information:

## **GitHub**

* **Name**: this name will be used by your Charles configuration. 
* **URL**: if you have a custom domain, add it here. If you don't, add a pattern value here [https://github.com](https://github.com) \(without the trailing "/\").
* **Token**: when [**this token**](https://help.github.com/pt/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) is generated, it needs to have all access to the **"repo"** item. 

## **GitLab**

* **Name**: this name will be used by your Charles configuration.
* **URL**: if you have a custom domain, add it here. If you don't, add a pattern value here [https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/) \(without the trailing "/\"). 
* **Token**: check out the documentation[ **on how to create a token**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/#personalproject-access-tokens).
