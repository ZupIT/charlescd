# Docker Registry

To configure your workspace, you have to register on the docker registry where your application's images are stored. This access is important because CharlesCD can watch new generated images and list the ones already saved in your registry to implement them.

There are two configuration registry categories that can be done in your workspace. You choose one and add the following information:

## AWS

* **Name**: this name will be used for your Charles configuration;
* **Your registry's URL**: according to the convention, the URL pattern for your registry is: [https://**aws\_account\_id**.dkr.ecr.**region**.amazonaws.com](https://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com);
* **Access Key**: security information generated by AWS IAM;
* **Secret Key**: security information generated by AWS IAM;
* **Region**: the region where you are located. 

If you have any doubts on how to proceed or find the information above, you can visit the [**documentation of Amazon ECR**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html).

## AZURE

* **Name**: this name will be used for your Charles configuration;
* **Your registry's URL**: the URL pattern for your registry is

  [https://**aws\_account\_id**.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com](https://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com);

* **Username**: this is the service's entity ID that will be used by Kubernetes to access the registry;
* **Password**: Service's entity password.

If you have any doubts on how to proceed or find those information above, you can visit the documentation [**Azure Container Registry**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-concepts).
