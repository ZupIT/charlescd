# About
CharlesCD is an open source project that deploys quickly, continuously and securely, allowing development teams to simultaneously perform hypothesis validations with specific groups of users.

It is possible to segment your customers through specific characteristics (circles) and, at the same time, submit several versions of the same application for testing with users of the circles.

## How was the product born?
The concept behind the project refers to the theory proposed by biologist Charles Darwin (1809-1882), that is, that evolution occurs through adaptation to a new environment. In the case of development, this evolution occurs through constant improvements in applications when building and testing hypotheses in order to deploy the most accurate and effective releases.

CharlesCD offers a solution to the developer community that would enhance the work of deploying and testing hypotheses, allowing faster problems identification and the execution of possible solutions to solve them.

For this reason, we consider that CharlesCD is the application of Darwinism within the universe of development and programming.

## What does Charles do?
* Simple segmentation of users based on their profile or even demographic data;
* Creation of deployment strategies in an easier and more sophisticated way using the circles;
* Easy version management in case of multiple releases in parallel in the production environment;
* Monitoring the impacts of each version using metrics defined during the creation of the deployment.
