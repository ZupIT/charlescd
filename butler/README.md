## **About**
Butler is a Kubernetes deployment tool that abstracts the routing feature of Istio's service mesh. It enables access to different applications versions based on a custom header value. 

## **How does Butler work?** 

* Butler has a pluggable architecture and enables different Continuous Deployment (CD) tools that communicate with the Kubernetes cluster.
* It abstracts the state of the cluster inside its database, diminishing the coupling with Continuous Deployment (CD) tools, therefore allowing them to be changed without a problem.
* It has an easy-to-use API that enables the deployment of various applications at the same time.

## **Usage**

### **Requirements**
See below the requirements to run Butler: 
- A working [**Node environment**](https://nodejs.org/en/);
- [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.


### **Configuration** 

1. Clone this project and run the following commands inside the root folder:

```
npm install
docker-compose up
npm start
```

2. These commands will install all project dependencies:
    - Run two containers with a PostgreSQL database and a stub server;
    - Start the application on port 3000.

A **Swagger API Documentation** is provided on application startup. We also provided a up to date [**Postman Collection**](https://www.postman.com/).

If you want to contribute to this module, access our [**Contributing Guide**](https://github.com/ZupIT/charlescd/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### **Developer Certificate of Origin - DCO**

 This is a security layer for the project and for the developers. It is mandatory.
 
 Follow one of these two methods to add DCO to your commits:
 
**1. Command line**
 Follow the steps: 
 **Step 1:** Configure your local git environment adding the same name and e-mail configured at your GitHub account. It helps to sign commits manually during reviews and suggestions.

 ```
git config --global user.name “Name”
git config --global user.email “email@domain.com.br”
```
**Step 2:** Add the Signed-off-by line with the `'-s'` flag in the git commit command:

```
$ git commit -s -m "This is my commit message"
```

**2. GitHub website**
You can also manually sign your commits during GitHub reviews and suggestions, follow the steps below: 

**Step 1:** When the commit changes box opens, manually type or paste your signature in the comment box, see the example:

```
Signed-off-by: Name < e-mail address >
```

For this method, your name and e-mail must be the same registered on your GitHub account.
