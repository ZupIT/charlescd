# CharlesCD Villager

Villager is a tool that abstracts multiple cloud providers in order to provide a unique API to integrate with container registries.

## How Villager works

* Villager has a pluggable architecture that enables the integration with Container Registries of different cloud providers.
* It abstracts every cloud provider API implementations.
* Provides a unique API to search for tags, or listen to your registry to check if a given image is being uploaded.

## How to use

### Requirements
 - [Java 11]
 - [Docker]
 - [Docker Compose]
 - [Maven]

### Running on terminal

Inside the root folder, run the following command:

```
docker-compose up
mvn clean install
mvn compile quarkus:dev
```

These commands will install all project dependencies, run two containers with a PostgreSQL database and a stub server and finally, start the application on port 8080.
